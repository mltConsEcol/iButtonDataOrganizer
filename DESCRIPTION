Description: This packages is designed for reading and compilation of data
    output from thermal dataloggers, iButtons. For various purposes, iButton users
    may have sets of data loggers in deployed, which may be are periodically swapped
    out. From each iButton, we can download a .csv file of the data, containing
    header information, and subsequent rows containing date/time and temperature
    data. The functions herein will load temperature from multiple iButtons from
    within a folder into a single data object (ReadiButtonFolder), load data
    from a single file if desired, and join multiple, multi-logger datasets (from
    ReadiButtonFolder) that span different temporal ranges. The functions that
    import entire folders of iButton data assume loggers may not be entirely
    synchronized (which is typical if manually setting them), and options exist for
    rounding to nearest 1 minute, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, and 2 hrs.
